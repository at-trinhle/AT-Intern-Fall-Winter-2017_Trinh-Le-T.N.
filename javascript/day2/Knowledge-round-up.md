<?>What are the differences between 'function declaration' and 'function expressions'?
  - 'Declaration function' can be called before declaration or after declaration
  - 'Expression function' must have a sequence, declaration and then call it.
<?>What is 'parameters' in function using for?
  - Parameters are declared when we define a function. Example:
    function checkSum (para1, para2){
      //do sth
    }
    para1, para2: parameters
<?>Is there a max number of arguments javascript functions can accept?
  - The limits are entirely up to the implementation and will most likely depend on how you call the function and the browser you are using.
